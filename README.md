## About The Project
This project implements a RESTful microservices-based system for managing a star catalog, allowing users to explore, add, update, and purchase stars from a database. The system integrates the key concepts of the MEAN stack architecture, providing separate microservices for user management, star management, and purchase handling.

The project features:
- A RESTful API for interacting with the system.
- Microservice architecture with independent services.
- MongoDB database with separate collections for users, stars, and purchases.
- Role-based access control to ensure secure operations.
